# Section 3: Heterozygosity is concentrated in distinct regions of the H. bakeri genome

[**snp_density**](https://github.com/lstevens17/heligmosomoides_MS/tree/main/3_heterozygosity/snp_density)

Contains code and files to plot SNP density in three H. bakeri individuals and two H. polygyrus individuals relative to the reference genome. A BED file for each individual contains SNP density in 10 kb windows, which are plotted by two R scripts (plot_SNP_density_Fig3.R and plot_SNP_density_other_individuals.R).
